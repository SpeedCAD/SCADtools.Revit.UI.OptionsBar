# SCADtools.Revit.UI.OptionsBar
Represents a custom options bar that will be displayed in the native Revit options bar.

Its main methods are: **Show()** and **Hide()**.

The OptionsBar library provides a set of predefined user-friendly controls that can be added to the options bar, such as **Button**, **LabelCheckBox**, **LabelComboBoxImage**, **LabelComboBox**, **LabelTextBox**, and **Separator**. Additionally, for users who seek even more customization, the library allows the incorporation of user-defined controls. With these controls, you can easily integrate a custom options bar into the Revit interface, allowing the user to access different settings without needing to open often annoying dialog boxes. Below are some examples of how this options bar is displayed.
